This file describes the "map.txt" and the "objects.txt" files
--------------
objects.txt:
It is a list of IDs and URL of geometryFiles separeted with commas of the robots in the enviroment, negative IDs are inmobile objects and need also x,y,theta(in radians) in m

example:
-1,/geomFile1.txt,0,5,0
-8,/geomFile2.txt,-1.2,0,3.14
0,/geomFile3.txt
8,/geomFile3.txt
12,/geomFile4.txt

-----------------
map.txt:
It is a matrix of numbers that represents the robots visibility, -1 it is not visible, 0 it is visible and any other positive number it is visible and also a radio in mm.
NOTE: First column is ID number. It is a Nx(N+1) matrix, with N number of robots, an i colon represent the robot of the row i-1.
	   
	   can see
	Robot0 Robot12 Robot8
Robot0	  10      0      -1
Robot12   -1	  2	 -1
Robot8     0     -1       0

It is read like:
Robot0 can see Robot0 position and objects in a radio of 10mm from Robot0
Robot0 can see Robot12 position
Robot0 cannot see Robot8 position

Robot12 cannot see Robot0 position
Robot12 can see Robot12 position and objects in a radio of 2mm from Robot8
Robot12 cannot see Robot8 position

Robot8 can see Robot0 position
Robot8 cannot see Robot12 position
Robot8 can see Robot8 position

example:
0,10,0,-1
12,-1,2,-1
8,0,-1,0
